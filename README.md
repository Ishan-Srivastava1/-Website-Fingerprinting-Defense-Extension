## Introduction

Website fingerprinting is a privacy-invasive technique where attackers deduce a user's web activity by analyzing network traffic patterns. This project implements a **browser extension** to counter these attacks using an adaptive padding algorithm. The defense dynamically adjusts traffic patterns to obscure user activities, rendering attackers' fingerprinting efforts ineffective.

### Why This Matters:
- **Resistant to VPN and Tor Fingerprinting**: Unlike cookies, fingerprinting cannot be erased or easily avoided.
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Mitigates risks of identity theft, fraud, and manipulative advertising.
- **Efficient Defense**: Balances privacy and usability by minimizing performance degradation.

---

## Key Highlights
- Simulates **realistic traffic patterns** using burst and gap modes.
- Randomizes dummy packet **size and content** to prevent predictable patterns.
- Provides a **user-friendly interface** for toggling protection and adjusting privacy settings.
- Displays **real-time metrics** like dummy packets sent and intercepted real packets.

---

## Key Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the adaptive padding algorithm and Chrome Extensions API functionality.
- **Python**: For initial simulations and performance analysis of the histogram-based delay sampling.
- **Chrome Extensions API**: To create the browser extension and manage event listeners for web traffic.
- **HTML & CSS**: For building the intuitive user interface.
- **DOM Manipulation**: For real-time metric updates in the UI, such as dummy packets and burst/gap states.

## Features

### Dynamic Mode Switching
Shifts between **burst** (high traffic) and **gap** (low traffic) states based on real-time activity.

### Histogram-Based Padding
Uses **probabilistic sampling** to mimic realistic inter-packet delays and avoid detection.

### Adjustable Privacy Levels
Allows users to control the **intensity of padding**, offering a tradeoff between usability and privacy.

### Real-Time Metrics
Includes a dashboard that displays:
- Total dummy packets sent
- Packets sent during burst and gap states
- Real packets intercepted

---

## Methodology

The adaptive defense uses two key modes:
1. **Burst Mode**: Activated during high traffic periods. Inter-packet delays are modeled using a burst histogram.
2. **Gap Mode**: Activated during low activity. Dummy packets are sent at intervals based on a gap histogram.

### Key Innovations:
- **Histogram Sampling**: Probabilistically selects delays to mimic real traffic patterns.
- **Randomized Packet Content**: Ensures packets vary in size and content, avoiding detection.
- **User Interface**: Simple yet functional interface for toggling the extension and viewing real-time metrics.

---

## Results

The extension was tested on websites like **CNN** and demonstrated:
- Smooth transitions between burst and gap modes.
- Randomized dummy packets that significantly reduced identifiable patterns.
- Real-time metrics validating the interception and obfuscation of traffic.

## Future Directions

### Potential Enhancements:
1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Train a model to adapt padding dynamically based on real-time traffic patterns.
2. **Protocol Expansion**: Add support for WebSocket, HTTP/2, QUIC, and other advanced protocols.
3. **Universal Defense**: Combine adaptive learning with protocol support for a comprehensive solution.
